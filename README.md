# Minimal Ethereum Mixer

This is the monorepo for all code and documentation for a minimal Ethereum
mixer. It allows you to cryptographically break the link between a source and
destination address for ETH transfers. It does this via zero-knowledge proofs
which let withdrawals occur securely without revealing the original address
which made a deposit. It relies on a centralised broadcaster server, but the
system is non-custodial and trustless.

A technical specification can be found
[here](https://hackmd.io/qlKORn5MSOes1WtsEznu_g).
